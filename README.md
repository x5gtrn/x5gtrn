# 🎛️ Daisuke Masuda — Code × Beats × Future

**Software Developer by day, Techno DJ/Producer by night**

Bridging code and beats since the dial-up era.

---

## **🚀 Now Building**

**Engineering:** 21+ years crafting Java solutions, full-stack problem solving, automation everything  
**Music:** 22+ years behind the decks — vinyl foundations → Traktor Pro mastery (decade+) → 2025: **active producer**

Currently channeling my systematic engineering mindset into hypnotic techno production. From analog precision to digital control to original creation — every evolution builds on systematic thinking.

## **🎵 Musical DNA**

Deeply influenced by **[Richie Hawtin](https://ra.co/dj/richiehawtin)**'s approach to sonic reduction and technological integration. His philosophy of minimal precision and system thinking shapes my transition from deck manipulation to original composition. 2025 marks my full commitment to building tomorrow's underground sound.

Equally shaped by **[Sven Väth](https://ra.co/dj/svenvath)**'s profound reverence for each individual track and his commitment to traditional DJ craftsmanship. Where technology drives toward seamless integration, Väth celebrates every record as a distinct sonic entity, weaving immersive worlds through careful selection and human intuition rather than digital manipulation. This respect for the integrity of individual compositions keeps me grounded in the timeless art of curation as I transition into original creation.

## 🔗 Digital Presence

🎧 **Listen:** [DJ Ekusi on SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/x5gtrn) - Mixes, WIP tracks, future releases  
📝 **Process:** [2025 Production Roadmap](https://scrapbox.io/x5gtrn) - Real-time creative documentation  
🤖 **Experiment:** [daisuke.masuda.tokyo](https://daisuke.masuda.tokyo) - AI-driven auto-updating articles for my learning and to share

## ⚡ 2025 Production Pipeline

- **Q1-Q2:** Foundation mastery - sound design, arrangement, mixing fundamentals
- **Q3-Q4:** Original releases and live performance integration  
- **Beyond:** Merging code creativity with sonic innovation

**Philosophy:** Automation over repetition. Humans judge, machines iterate. Clean architecture applies to everything.
