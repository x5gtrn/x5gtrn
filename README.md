# 🎛️ Daisuke Masuda — Code × Beats × Future

**Lead Engineer by day, Techno DJ/active producer by night**

Bridging code and beats since the dial-up era.

## **🚀 Now Building**

**Engineering:** 21+ years crafting Java solutions, full-stack problem solving, automation everything  
**Music:** 22+ years behind the decks — vinyl foundations → Traktor Pro mastery (decade+) → 2025: **active producer**

Currently channeling my systematic engineering mindset into hypnotic techno production. From analog precision to digital control to original creation — every evolution builds on systematic thinking.

## **🎵 Musical DNA**

Deeply influenced by **Richie Hawtin**'s approach to sonic reduction and technological integration. His philosophy of minimal precision and system thinking shapes my transition from deck manipulation to original composition. 2025 marks my full commitment to building tomorrow's underground sound.

```java
// Life philosophy in code
public class Creative {
    private final Passion engineering = new Java();
    private final Passion music = new MinimalTechno();
    
    public void evolve() {
        while (true) {
            engineering.optimize();
            music.produce();
            future.hack();
        }
    }
}
```
